## Motivation

design with Sass (scss)
I wanted to improve my style with Sass. To do this, I used the official Sass documentation for :
- @import & @use
- $colors
- @mixin & @include

## Animation

I also combined Sass with animation. At start, a computer face appears & smiles after a while.

## Dropdown Menu

I created a dropdown menu for training.
